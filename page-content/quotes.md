— James Clear

> If you are homo sapiens, you evolved for group combat and confirmation basis and motivated reasoning we are not  evolved to be academics or scientists searching for truth in an unbiased way we evolved to win in social competitions.

— James Clear

> Few people are logical. Most of us are prejudiced and biased. Most of us are blighted with preconceived notions, with jealousy, suspicion, fear, envy and pride. And most citizens don't want to change their minds about their religion or their haircut or communism or their favourite movie star.
— Dale Carnegie

> You can tell people they are wrong by a look or an intonation or a gesture just as eloquently as you can in words – and if you tell them they are wrong, do you make them want to agree with you? Never! For you have struck a direct blow at their intelligence, judgement, pride and self-respect. That will make them want to strike back. But it will never make them want to change their minds. You may then hurl at them all the logic of a Plato or an Immanuel Kant, but you will not alter their opinions, for you have hurt their feelings.

— Seneca

> You cannot understand good design if you do not understand people.
— Dieter Rams

> So perhaps the point of personal productivity is not to minimize work or maximize efficiency, but rather to reach some level of financial security. And though the idea of early retirement is absurd, no one who can achieve it will  take it, perhaps the better idea of early retirement is to retire from the need to force yourself to be productive. It's to give yourself permission to enjoy what you do and take your time on it, and not be under the gun to keep shipping as fast as possible.

> Brilliance might appear to win in the moment, but positioning wins in the end.
— Farnam Street

> We win the moment at the cost of the decade. Examples of this are everywhere. For example, we skip necessary maintenance on core assets to juice returns, we accrue technical debt that goes unpaid, and we monetize buffers and margins of safety. In the process, the smallest shock can cause massive damage. We fail to take care of ourselves. We don't eat healthy, sleep right, or exercise enough. When problems come, we're ill-positioned to deal with them. We try to save time. We cut corners on a job and cringe when we have to fix our mistakes.

— Neal Stephenson

> To think the affairs of this life are always to remain in the same state, is an erroneous fancy. The face of things rather seems continually to change and roll with circular motion; summer succeeds the spring, autumn the summer, winter the autumn, and then spring again. So time proceeds in this perpetual round; only the life of man is ever hastening to its end, swifter than time itself, without hopes to be renewed, unless in the next, that is unlimited and infinite.

— Charlie Munger

> Living in dominance hierarchies as he does, like all his ancestors before him man was born mostly to follow leaders, with only a few people doing the leading. And so, human society is formally organized into dominance hierarchies, with their culture augmenting the natural follow-the-leader tendency of man.

— Charlie Munger

> The proper antidotes to being made such a patsy by past success are (1) to carefully examine each past success, looking for accidental, non-causative factors associated with such success that will tend to mislead one as one appraises odds implicit in a proposed new undertaking and (2) to look for dangerous aspects of the new undertaking that were not present when past success occurred.

— Warren Buffet

> We all deal much with others whom we correctly diagnose as imprisoned in poor conclusions that are maintained by mental habits they formed early and will carry to their graves.
— Charlie Munger

> The brain of man conserves programming space by being reluctant to change which is a form of inconsistency avoidance. We see this in all human habits, construtive and destructive. Few people can most a lot of bad habit that they have eliminated, and some cannot identify even one of these.
— Charlie Munger

— Morgan Housel

> If the risk taken does pan out, it is good. But if it doesn't — and here's the key thing — we find a way to justify the risk taken as learning. That's the secret. If our goal is to live a good life without regrets, it's so important to internalize Dunn's quote. If we choose the path that doesn't speak to our souls but feels safer, there's a very strong likelihood that we'll ask that dreaded question years later: What if? What if we took the plunge? But if we choose the risky path and it doesn't work out, we can (usually) call it a learning experience and move on. There's very little thinking about what would have happened if we had taken the safe path.

> An open heart finds friends almost anywhere it goes.
— Andy Dunn

> Dave in his life took the risk of traveling first and then the risk of quitting a job he grew tired of second. He was an inspiration when it comes to avoiding the risk not taken. He is also a past tense person, because he's gone. Unfathomably we lost Dave in 2011. Too bright a light to go out at thirty-five, and yet on he went. He was too alive to die, and yet that's not how it works.
— Andy Dunn

> What does count is a perspective on what wealth  is. Wealth is the substance in you, it's the people that care for you and that you care for, it is experiences had and perspective acquired.

> I wanted to be like them. Imitation, it turns out, is a great engine for personal growth. I decided to travel as much as I could. Over the next four years, squeezed between another job and two years in business school, I went to thirty countries. Over the past decade, I think the number is closer to fifty.
— Andy Dunn

> While the serial option and lottery ticket buyers seem like different creatures, they are, in fact, close cousins. Both types postpone their dreams and undertake choices that they think will enable their dreams. But they fail to understand that all of these intervening choices will change them fundamentally—and they are, in fact, the sum total of those choices.
— Mihir A. Desai

> Relentlessly prune bullshit. Don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time that you have. That's what you do when life is short.
— Paul Graham

> I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much of something: Try to get more of it, and savor what one has. Both make sense for life.
— Paul Graham

> One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future. Fake stuff that matters little usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter. That's how it tricks you. The area under the curve is small, but its shape jabs into your consciousness like a pin.
— Paul Graham

> And this is where we get to the core difference. Why investment is so important.Investment and foregoing options are necessary for any growth. If you want a relationship to grow, you can't keep the freedom to date anyone you want. If you want a business to grow, you have to sacrifice the freedom to work on anything you want. If you want a (financial) investment to grow, you have to surrender the freedom to use that money for whatever you want. Don't commit to something. Invest in something.
— Nat Eliason

> You have to invest to grow and investment means giving up other options. It means trading freedom for the potential of growth
— Nat Eliason

> Just as constant task switching erodes your short term productivity, constantly changing your big picture focus will destroy your long-term productivity.

> The human brain must often operate counterproductively just like the ant's from unavoidable oversimplicity in its mental process, albeit usually in trying to solve problems more difficult than those faced by ants that don't have to design airplanes.
— Charlie Munger

> We are too soon old and too late smart.
— German Proverb

> When I started law practice, I had respect for the power of genetic evolution and appreciation of man's many evolution based resemblances to less cognitively-gifted animals and insects. I was aware that man was a social animal, greatly and automatically influenced by behavior he observed in men around him. I also knew that man lived like barnyard animals and monkeys, in limited size dominance hierarchies, wherein he tended to respect authority and to like and cooperate with his own hierarchy members while displaying considerable distrust and dislike for competing men not in his own hierarchy.

I think it's a huge mistake not to absorb elementary worldly wisdom if you're capable of doing it because it makes you better able to serve others, it makes you better able to serve yourself, and it makes life more fun. So if you have an aptitude for doing it, I think you'd be crazy not to. Your life will be enriched - Not only financially, but in a host of other ways - if you do.

Plus, if you figure it out and do the outlining yourself the ideas will stick better than if you memorize 'em using somebody else's cram list. Even better, the fun never stops. I was miseducated horribly. And I hadn't bothered to pick up what's called modern Darwinism. I do a lot of miscellaneous reading, too. But I just missed it.

But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts. Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day and at the end of the day if you live long enough like most people you will get out of life what you deserve. Life and its various passages can be hard, brutally hard. The three things I have found helpful in coping with its challenges are: \n- Have low Expectations \n- Have a sense of humor \n- Surround yourself with the love of friends and family \n- Above all live with change and adapt to it. If the world didn't change I'd still have a twelve handicap.

Nearly everything is  interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don't think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn't stop you from doing anything at all.

> Spacetime is sometimes referred to as the block universe because within it the whole of physical reality, past, present and future is laid out once and for all frozen in a single four dimensional block.

From the point of view of an observer at a particular moment that moment is indeed singled out and may uniquely be called now by that observer just as any position in space is singled out as here from the point of view of an observer at that position.
— David Deutsch

> What then is time? If no one asks me I know, but if I wish to explain it to someone who asks, I know not.
— St. Augustine

> Unlike the relationships between physical entities relationships between abstract entities are independent of any contingent facts and of any laws of physics. They are determined absolutely and objectively by the autonomous properties of the abstract entities themselves.
— David Deutsch

> So explanation does after all play the same paramount role in pure mathematics as it does in science.
— David Deutsch

> So by about 1900 there was a crisis at the foundations of mathematics — namely that there were no foundations.
— David Deutsch

> And the largest scale regular structures across universes exist where knowledge bearing matter such as brains or DNA gene segments have evolved.
— David Deutsch

> Astrologers used to believe that cosmic events influence human affairs; science believed for centuries that neither influences the other. Now we see that human affairs influence cosmic events!
— David Deutsch 

> It is the survival of knowledge and not necessarily of the gene or any other physical object that is the common factor between replicating and non replicating genes.
— David Deutsch

> If the earth were enveloped in a large solar flare, itself an insignificant event astrophysically, our biosphere would be instantly sterilized, and that catastrophe would have as little effect on the sun as a raindrop has on an erupting volcano.
— David Deutsch

> In everyday parlance we speak of organisms reproducing themselves, indeed this was one of the supposed characteristics of living things. In other words we think of organisms as replicators. But this is inaccurate. Organisms are not copied during reproduction, far less do they cause their copying. They are constructed afresh according to blueprints embodied in the parent organisms DNA.
— David Deutsch

> It is a fact of life that there exist molecules which cause certain environments to make copies of those molecules. Such molecules are called replicators.
— David Deutsch

> If something kicks back it exists.
— David Deutsch

> There are mathematical symbols in physical reality. The fact that it is we who put them there does not make them any less physical. In those symbols in our planetariums, books, films and computer memories and in our brains there are images of physical reality at large. Images, not just of the appearances of objects but of the structure of reality.
— David Deutsch

> If a substantial amount of computation would be required to give us the illusion that a certain entity is real, then that entity is real.
— David Deutsch

> If according to the simplest explanation an entity is complex and autonomous that entity is real.
— David Deutsch

> We need to develop reasons for accepting or rejecting the existence of entities that may appear in contending theories. In other words we need a criterion for reality.
— David Deutsch

> Our judgement of what is or is not real always depend on the various explanations that are available to us, and sometimes change as our explanations improve.
— David Deutsch

> Explanations are not justified by the means by which they were derived they are justified by the superior ability relative to rival explanations to solve the problems they address.
— David Deutsch

> As I have said the Inquisition were realists. Yet their theory has this in common with solipsism. Both of them draw an arbitrary boundary beyond which they claim human reason has no access or at least beyond which problem-solving is no oath to understanding.
— David Deutsch

> Do not complicate explanations beyond necessity.
— David Deutsch

> The book of Nature is written in mathematical symbols.
— Galileo Galilei

> What then entitles a human mind to draw conclusions about objective external reality from its own purely subjective experience and reason?
— David Deutsch

> As a child I merely knew this. Now I can explain it.
— David Deutsch

> The purpose of high level sciences is to enable us to understand emergent phenomena of which the most important are life, thought and computation.
— David Deutsch

> Scientific theories explain the object and phenomena of our experience in terms of an underlying reality which we do not experience directly. But the ability of a theory to explain what we experience is not its most valuable attribute. Its most valuable attribute is that it explains the fabric of reality itself.
— David Deutsch

> Being able to predict things or to describe them however accurately is not at all the same thing as understanding them.
— David Deutsch

> Passing experimental tests is only one of many things a theory has to do to achieve the real purpose of science, which is to explain the world.
— David Deutsch

> We are as good at recognizing biases in others as we are bad at acknowledging our.
— Hugo Mercier

> Even geniuses need people to argue with to develop their best ideas.
— Hugo Mercier

> If you will not hear reason, she will surely rap your knuckles.
— Benjamin Franklin

> Avoid evil, particularly if they're attractive members of the opposite sex.
— Charlie Munger

> People don't think about the consequences of consequences.
— Charlie Munger

> A man who carries a cat by the tail learns something he can learn in no other way.
— Mark Twain

> Listening to today's forecasters is just as crazy as when the king hired the guy to look at the sheep guts. It happens over and over and over.
— Charlie Munger

> Don't gamble. Take all your savings and buy some good stick and hold it till it goes up then sell it. If it don't go up, don't buy it.
— Will Rogers

> The wisdom of the wise and the experience of ages may be preserved by quotations.
— Isaac Disraeli

> Ability will get you to the top but it takes character to keep you there.
— Abraham Lincoln

> Recognize and adapt to the true nature of the world around you, don't expect it to adapt to you.
— Charlie Munger

> Never fool yourself and remember that you are the easiest person to fool.
— Richard Feynman

> The task of a man is not to see what lies dimly in the distance but to do what lies at hand.
— Thomas Carlyle

> A human being is a part of the whole, called by us 'Universe', a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.
— Albert Einstein

> This is the central illusion in life: that randomness is risky, that it is a bad thing— and that eliminating randomness is done by eliminating randomness... Mediocristan has a lot of variations, not a single one of which is extreme; Extremistan has few variations, but those that take place are extreme. 
— Nicolas Nassim Taleb

> In retrospect, I realize that I had a very similar marketing plan to the man who may be considered the greatest marketer of all time: Jesus. In terms of longevity in the marketplaces, the movement he started is 2000 years old and is still going strong. It has 2.2 billion active users (over 30% of global population), annual revenue across all its subsidiaries is well into the billions of dollars. That's an unmatched scale, market penetration, and longevity.
— Tyler Pearson

> The chasing, the optimizing, the trying to save time is what wastes our time. It's only when we stop watching the clock that we enjoy the clock.
— Nat Eliason

> Optimization breeds discontent. We spend so much time focused on Not Wasting Time that we end up wasting our time optimizing our time. We transcend one unhappiness to replace it with another.
— Nat Eliason

> The current fascination with mindfulness is a particularly funny example of this since many of us are meditating to be more productive. We're practicing now-ness so we can better sacrifice the now for the future. Whoops.
— Nat Eliason 

> When a planet's life reaches high intelligence, it usually means they're a couple hundred thousand years away from their do-or-die moment. Their progress will accelerate faster and faster until finally they hit the God Point, when they simultaneously gain the power to forever end species vulnerability or drive themselves accidentally extinct—and it's all about which comes first.
— Tim Urban

> The dinosaurs became extinct because they didn't have a space program. And if we become extinct because we don't have a space program, it'll serve us right! 
— Larry Niven

> Today, many people have heard of SpaceX. Few know what SpaceX does. And even fewer know what SpaceX  does. Here's what SpaceX does: It takes things to space for people, for money. And as we established, here's what SpaceX  does: It's an innovation machine, trying to solve one big problem — the astronomical cost of space travel — because that's the key to making humanity a space-faring civilization that can become multi-planetary and back itself up on other hard drives. It supports itself by taking things to space for people, for money.
— Tim Urban
