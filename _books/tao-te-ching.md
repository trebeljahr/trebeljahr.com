> When nothing is done, nothing is left undone. 

> Darkness within darkness. The gateway to all understanding. 

> When you are content to be simply yourself and don't compare or compete, everybody will respect you. 

> Look, and it can't be seen. Listen, and it can't be heard. Reach, and it can't be grasped.

> If you realize that you have enough, you are truly rich. 

> When there is no desire, all things are at peace. 

> Do your work, then step back. The only path to serenity. 

> The Tao doesn't take sides; it gives birth to both good and evil. The master doesn't take sides; she welcomes both saints and sinners. 

> If you look to others for fulfillment, you will never be truly fulfilled. If your happiness depends on money, you will never be happy with yourself. 

> The more you know, the less you understand. 

> Those who know don't talk. Those who talk don't know. 

> Governing a large country is like frying a small fish. You spoil it with too much poking. 

> If you want to learn how to govern, avoid being clever or rich. The simplest pattern is the clearest. Content with an ordinary life, you can show all peoe the way back to their own true nature. 

> All streams flow to the sea because it is lower than they are. Humility gives it its power. 

> True words seem paradoxical. 

> The true name of eternity is Today. 

> When I know myself, I know others. When I master myself, I don't need to master others.
