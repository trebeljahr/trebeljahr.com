This book is worth it if you don't yet know how to travel on a budget and still need that paradigm shift of... "Oh wait, you can travel the world, while spending less money then what you would have spent when you stayed at home in Europe or the US?" 

If however you have already acquired this mindset in some other way, by reading Matt Kepnes' awesome blog, by traveling yourself or maybe even by watching YouTube videos or whatever, you don't have to read this book. Most of the strategies in it, you will also get to know and pick up on the road yourself pretty quickly while out traveling. And quite a few things within it are very US centric, especially the sections on travel hacking with US credit card rewards and similar things. 

Overall it's still a good book though I think, but for me I guess, that I have read it at the wrong time, reducing it's value, for me personally, greatly. Like all books, their value depends greatly on when you read them.
