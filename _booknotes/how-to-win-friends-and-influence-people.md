## Summary: 

This is one of the best self-help books in existence. The insights, even though in the end, somehow basic, are incredibly powerful ideas about how humans interact with one another efficiently. To me, the title is one of the most misleading. It puts a bad wrap on the whole book because it makes it seem to be about manipulation, but that couldn't be further from the truth. In reality, the book is simply about one thing - getting along with people well and building lasting, genuine relationships with them. 

In a few words, it can be summarized as - care for other people because they care for themselves as much as you care for yourself. Everybody is the main character in their life. You should treat people like that, without expecting anything in return. Treat them like they are the main character, because to them, they are. 

Just be genuinely friendly and helpful where possible. Arguing, and letting the ego get in the way are always the wrong things to do. Because humans are not rational arguing machines, instead they are irrational beings, who usually get more entrenched in their opinions when you confront them with why they are wrong.

Changing or influencing people, therefore, doesn't happen with argument. It happens more subtly, by being involved with their lives, caring for and appreciating their point of view. And if you don't do that, you'll have a hard time, both in personal and professional relationships. 

And that's what this book is about in the end, it is trying to make you a better person, by understanding how other people "work".
