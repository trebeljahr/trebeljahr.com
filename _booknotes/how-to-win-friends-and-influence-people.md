This is one of the best self helf books in existence. The insights, even though in the end, somehow basic in nature, are incredibly powerful ideas about how humans interact with one another efficiently. To me the title is one of the most misleading, because it puts a bad wrap to the whole book, because it makes it seem to be about manipulation, but that couldn't be further from the truth. In reality the book is simply about one thing - getting along with people well and building lasting, genuine relationships with them. 

In a few words it can be summarized as - care for other people, because they care for themselves as much as you care for yourself. Everybody is the main character in their life, treat people like that, without expecting anything in return, just be genuinely friendly and helpful where possible is the way to go. Arguing, and letting the ego get in the way are always the wrong things to do. Because humans are not rational arguing machines, instead they are irrational beings, who usually get more entrenched in their opinions when you confront them with why they are wrong. 

Changing or influencing people therefore doesn't happen with argument. It happens more subtly, by being involved with their lives, caring and appreciating their point of view. And if you don't do that, you'll have a hard time, both in personal and professional relationships. 

And that's what this book is about in the end, it is trying to make you a better human, by understanding how other people "work".
