## Flow

This leads me to another point or idea that shapes my world, except the one for progress. And that is the idea of losing myself in progressing. Something that relates all the above to each other is that they are set up perfectly to forget time.
To be able to do them and completely lose all sense of the world around them. I get sucked into a mindless state of concentration, by these activities. Something so many other people also know. Something called flow. So not only do I want to stretch myself to progress, but I also want to experience flow. Being stretched to exhaustion but was happy in doing what I love. Being in flow, getting more experience, expanding my skills, my knowledge, progressing but without things feeling like work. This is the intersection point that I want to spend most of my time at. The point where work seems and feels effortless. Where I can be concentrated and learn and time, hours pass by and it almost feels like waking up from a deep sleep when something ruptures this type of concentration. To me all of those activities share a common factor in this. The focus and all-consuming attention they require to just get right is enormous and this stretching, this concentration, this gathering of skill and mind, pouring into one task to get to the desired outcome is what I want. What I seek. It reminds me a lot of meditation where one does the same, only that while meditating the focus is on something that does not usually need concentration, something that is natural to us, something that would just happen. And in doing this work of concentrating on the breath, on the feeling of the body, on the calmness of the mind, on the sensation of being, I can also become at peace. With myself, with my mind, while minutes and then hours pass by without noticing. Because I am stretched into this pursuit of skill, lost in utmost concentration and that is worthwhile. So in a sense, all of the activities listed above, at least for me, are a kind of meditation. They are things that I know can get me into flow states reliably and therefore I want to do them more often the more often I do each of them, the more reliably they can catapult me into these flow states and therefore the more I can lose myself in being at ease. At rest at peace, bent into concentration, bent into doing something meaningful. Something meaningful to me, something that leads to me forgetting myself, my ego, my ideas, and my surroundings. And that feels amazing. Especially if coupled with the rush that comes after realizing that in these phases of flow a creative process has happened, something that I can take out of them, something that reminds me of the process, a result, a progression. Something worthwhile.

In Parkour this would be a new skill of movement, in photography, this would be an array of pictures I like, in painting it would be a piece of art, in programming, it would be a product or website that I wrote, in music this would be a piece of music I composed, in a language that would be a conversation I can have with someone in their mother tongue, in writing it would be a piece of text, that I like. All of the activities I value have this in common. They are flow states, that in the end create something. And this something is a measure of progress, a measure of the flow state and something that is so pleasing to have because all these things are in the end accomplishments. Things that I created, things that I made. Things that I can show to others, to communicate who I am and what makes me - me.

This expression of individuality in all of the skills is what they are about as well. It is one of the driving forces, the motivation, if you so will, to keep going. The motivation to move on, to grow, to do greater and better things than before, to reach out there and see how far one can get. And this again is worthwhile on its own but the things one gets to show for it, the things that make the journey memorable and graspable are what keep me awake at night. But realizing this, these tokens of feats done, are also what cause FOMO, because when doing more than one thing there is simply not enough time to outdo somebody who has a razor-sharp focus. The more things one does, the lesser the distance one can cover and therefore the number and greatness of the things brought back from those journeys of flow become less if compared to the tokens other people had accomplished during their lifetimes.

But I think this is fine. It stings the ego, but it is fine. Because losing myself and becoming better than I was yesterday is on their worthwhile and can make me happy and an overdriven ego is something that probably makes you unhappy anyways. So, it should not be too important to be the best at the things we do. If only we are a little better than the day before and overall have a sense of progression and spend as much time as possible within the zone of flow, we should be happy. Right?

## A deeper truth about myself

The sting though. When reading these words they at the same time sound so right and so wrong to me. Because something inside of me *wants* to bet the best, it wants to compete, not with myself but with others. It wants to win at this stupid race that is nonexistent and it threatens to kill all the joy in my life. 

And I wonder how it got there. And why it exists. This feeling of wanting to be better, to excel, to outgrow and be better than others. It is nested deep within me and I do not like it sometimes and think about whether there are ways to change it. [Where does it come from](/posts/sense-of-progress)?

Because, in the end, this is something that could keep me from trying. In the end, it is [the fixed mindset](/booknotes/mindset), afraid of failure, internally aching when others are better than me. And this mindset taints the things I enjoy so quickly, simply because of others being better at them than I am. 

This makes me angry at myself because this is stupid. And I know it to be stupid. And yet it is [a fundamental problem of my life](/posts/fundamental-problems).

## A sense of progress.

I think the theme unifying all of the points above is that I like to learn and experience new stuff and gradually become better at it by practicing and learning and practicing and making new experiences. It feels exhilarating to know stuff. 

When something makes me click and I finally understand something better, that makes me tremendously happy. There are those moments where I just can't help myself but smile and almost brim with happiness that makes me beam and dance around my tiny little room at home to the music that is on.

So what is the core value that I want to drive my life – the one theme unifying it all? It is curiosity and a passion for learning. But then I have to ask, why. Why do I feel that it is so important to learn new stuff constantly?

Why is learning so important to me?

It turns out that the thing that excites me about learning is not so much the learning itself and neither is it the point of knowing more than before and neither is it the ability to then explain and share it with others. It is way simpler than that. I crave improvement. Above all.

## Improvement is the Purpose of Life.

When I think of why I want to learn and understand things it is because I want to get better over time and I think that this is the unifying theme driving the whole of evolution forward. It is what moves me to tears when I am reading about the progress of technology, what I enjoy so much when I can solve a problem in coding after hours of failed attempts. It is why I practice and enjoy doing parkour and sports in general.

It is also what makes me addicted to games like Minecraft, especially the modded versions, where a sense of progress is all the game is about. The whole purpose being that you can build upon the stuff you built previously and therefore progress.

Progression. That's what fundamentally all life is about. It is what life has always been about and it is what I am about and what I want to pursue during my lifetime. I want to progress and progress and progress and build myself and my surroundings into something that is better than it was before.

I want to challenge myself by writing, by reading, by doing sports, by learning music, by traveling, by painting, by photographing, by coding...

So - my life is going to be one of progress, because that's what I ultimately want and value and therefore it is what I am going to pursue. Which makes me realize one thing. The fear of missing out is as useless to me as anything else because I am the happiest when stretching myself to the very edge. Experiencing new things, progressing. And missing out on things does not keep me from doing this. Quite the contrary, I'll have to accept that I am going to miss out on an awful lot, to  become happy. Because stretching myself into new situations requires to turn a blind eye onto the things, that I could become and instead focus on the challenge ahead. On the thing happening right there, right now. Right here.

Keeping up a mix of healthy habits of reading, writing, photographing, traveling, learning languages, coding, painting, doing sports - especially parkour and learning music should therefore be my top priorities in life. I want to do all of them and realize that when not pursuing all of them I will become unhappy. So doing all of them is what I  am. It is what I want to be and it is where I want to become better at. Not only at a single one of these, but at all of them. Even if that means that the distance in terms of skill I can travel in any single one of these is narrow and predefined. Because I am not single mindedly focusing on any of them I can only go that far. But since that's not what is important to me, I don't fucking care! As long as I get a little better in one of these by doing one of these every day I will be living a life worthwhile... A life I  enjoy. A life that to me seems worth living and a life that I can value.

Life is progression. All the way down to it's core. It is about becoming better - about evolution. And therefore my deepest and most ingrained value in life is just that. Progression. I want to grow as a human being in all the dimensions that I as a person encompass.

So - now that I cleared this up for myself I have to ask myself what can stop me from living this life I want, so that I can be able to navigate these possible obstacles and refine other values that exist only because of what I value.
