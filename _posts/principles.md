These are some of the ideas I found useful, condensed into a list, so that they are easily useable for me. I can only recommend to compile your own list of principles like this one. Pay attention to the things you think are important to your life. Pick and choose from my list if you feel like it, but also distill your own experiences and learnings, the things that are specifically important to you. 

That will really help to clarify your values and distill and extract what you have learned over your life into a checklist. Which you can then use to reason about decisions you have to make, or as a reminder of what is awesome in life. A tool to make you happy in dire times.  

I, personally, regularly come back here to check in, and refresh what I have already figured out. I want to drill those insights into my brain, so they stick there and remain, becoming an integral part of who I am over time.

If you compile a similar list to this please let me know. The idea is to spread them similar to /now or /needlestack pages. Something like /principles should totally be a thing that exists in the internet. This is heavily inspired by Ray Dalio's book (aptly named principles as well that you should read if you like this sort of content)...

Ok now without further ado, here's my list: 

1. Always fight the monkey brain. If you feel this little bit of pain just before doing an activity, this urge to procrastinate, you are not allowed to postpone this activity. Ever. Feeling this pain should serve as the definitive trigger to do the activity. Right at that moment, you have to fight against an old part of your brain that is evolutionarily useful but leads to bad outcomes today. So go. Fight. 


2. Spend a lot of time learning new things. The world is marvelous and extremely complex. Curiosity is your compass and knowing the world is extremely exhilarating. Never forget that you know almost nothing and that there is an infinity of unknown uncharted terrain left for you to be explore. 


3. Don't forget your friends and people close to you. Spend time with them. The ones you care for, who also care for you, are the most important part of your life. 


4. Go outside often. More often. And then more often than that. 


5. Do sports. HIIT. Push yourself to your maximum when training. 


6. Enjoy nature and food, the small things of your biology that can make you happy. 


7. Sleep plenty. And then some more. 


8. Eat healthy - intermittent fasting, most calories from protein, little carb rich stuff (especially no sugar or other things that spike blood glucose levels), drink green tea, don't mix fat with carbs, eat fats in the morning carbs towards the evening, avoid processed foods like the pest, not too much nuts, care about the quality of fats. Remember, lean, green, marine. Enough fish, not too many eggs, some good meat, lots of veggies. 


9. Be grateful. Notice when people do something cool, awesome or whatever and then tell them that they rock. Praise people for being awesome. And really mean it. 


10. Exercise skills regularly so they do not atrophy. Piano, Painting, Programming, Writing, Thinking. Or whatever it is that you do and value as a skill. 


11. Recognize addictions and lost control. Determine their impacts and then stop them. Nothing is as bad as losing control over what you can do. 


12. The universe is a stressful place and to err, fail and be hostile towards others is sadly very human. Be aware of that. Smile, greet and appreciate, where you can. If something bad happens to you, attribute to bad luck instead of malice and understand that other people are only human and err the same way you do. 


13. If sad/bogged down, think about the crazy facts of wonderfully, marvelous physical reality. The complexity that governs entities interacting with each other and the scale of it all. Also comprehend the utter meaninglessness of it all. As well as the beauty and grandiosity of it all. Remember the blue dot picture, the life calendar, our tiny slice of time, the photons hitting your eyes, the blind card magician, the connectedness of mathematics and physics and the craziness of the Fermi Paradox, and that we might very well be alone in an (almost) infinite universe. 


14. Also remember the atrocities and cruelty humans and by extension you are capable of and put them into perspective to what you have to endure. 


15. Think about the fact that you have so freaking much and appreciate that you are alive, (hopefully) healthy, probably not starving or dying of thirst, that you have clothes, an education and access to vast amounts of technology... That in principle you live a live that by comparison is **a lot** better than the lives of over 99% of humans that have ever walked upon earth. So don't forget, even if things are bad - they could be a lot worse.


16. Remember that there is boogie woogie, jazz and music in general that vibrating air can change your mood and make you move your feet.


17. See that while things are great, they can always be improved. Especially when looking at them in the long or very long term future. Even though you should be grateful, don't be content. 


18. Then ask yourself how you can make things better in the long term and then do the actions necessary to get closer towards that better future. Whatever better means in the long run for you. 


19. Stick with things long enough to see how far you can go and don't endlessly switch between the newest fads of yours. Do not lose the forest for all the trees and get lost in choices, becoming overwhelmed and bogged down by the knowledge that spending time, means you lose the opportunity to do anything else with that time. 


20. Be aware of your own biases, flaws and terrible nature. Know that you know basically nothing and that even the things you think you know are probably wrong. Remember that there is the Dunning Kruger Effect and similar biases and that all of these cloud your thinking and tend to lead to overvaluing your own opinion without even noticing that. Be humble and intellectually honest and aware of these shortcomings.


21. Try to move closer to truth by pulling at and updating your own beliefs continually. To do so, search more facts and opinions that are conflicting with your own. Try to disprove your ideas instead of proving them and then watch and see if they hold. Think of new ones. Iterate.


22. Know that other people want to be and **are** as important as you are. Not only important to themselves but also important to you. Without others you can't do shit. The marvels of society work in the background, without us noticing, not because of you, but because of other people that you do not even know, much less care about. Let that really sink in. 


23. Other people can be mightily different from you and therefore understanding others is a lot less common and way, way harder than you think. Misunderstanding is the default and making yourself understood properly as well as understanding others properly is one of the hardest things to do. But the rewards of getting that right are enormous. 


24. Remember that predicting the future from past data is often impossibly hard and eventually bound to fail in this messy chaotic world. There are black swans. So tread with the necessary caution and handle risks accordingly. 


25. And: Don't Panic. (for those who don't know Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy this is probably not funny, also you should go and read that. It's good ^^)
