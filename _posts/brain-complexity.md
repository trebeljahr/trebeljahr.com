Decisions are the most important thing in life, if you were to sum up your life in the most concise way possible it would be about the big decisions that you have made. And yet there is a problem with them... you can't really make them.

The question of free will is a really old one, but at the moment it looks like what our brains do is pre-determined by the environment. So what we experience as free will and the ability to choose is an illusion that our brains create to help us get along and be motivated to survive. 

## What decisions really are.

However in reality what really happens underneath, is neural networks chattering in their electronic signals, trying to get control over the motor circuits of our brain so that they can control the body. At each and every decision this is what happens, multiple networks of neurons fire and try to inhibit each other and gain control over the motor cortex. What we experience as a decision in the end is the network that ends up winning this competition over the activity of the motor neurons. 

That is when we move, we act out our decision. Something funny happens at that moment as well though, we start to think of that the thing we are doing as if we have decided it "ourselves", even if there was no "self" to be found anywhere along the way that made the decision. Only neurons communicating with each other, trying to gain control of some other neurons nearby. So, if we think about that, how can it be that you, me, or anybody, can "learn" to make better decisions? And where even does that decision come from? 

## Self-Reference.

I find questions like this very puzzling. They have this self-referential nature, which is the whole topic of Gödel, Escher, Bach (one of the greatest books of all time in my opinion, if you haven't you should really buy a copy and read it). 

Self-Reference is what makes differential equations and recursive algorithms behave in such interesting ways. It can create vast, un-interpretable and un-predictable complexities, from very simple facts and equations. And our brain is full of self-reference, nested in self-reference, nested in self-reference. You get the point. There are circuits, controlling circuits, which control the original circuits and so on, in nested loops, down to the very bottom of single neurons, all of which build up in a unique and highly complex pattern to make you you. 

Outputs of those loops to the motor circuits is really what decisions are in the end. The consequence of those recursive processes, manifesting in the intricate patterns of movement and behavior. So... what is one doing when one learns to make better decisions? 

I think it is the selective strengthening of only some of those recursive circuits, competing with each other, so that the outcome is overall nudged into a certain direction more often than not. That is essentially what habits are in the end as well. Since we know that what fires together wires together, when we perform an act it strengthens the circuit responsible for that act, and we are more likely to do it again in the future, especially if the immediate consequences of that act had a positive effect. 

## Meta-Decisions.

Now comes the recursive, meta-decision part, when you read this text, neurons in your brain map the words into understanding of the text and this text promises something that you want - how to make better decisions. Therefore the next time you have a difficult decision to make, your brain has changed a little bit, and the networks within it that correspond to long term interest are just a little bit stronger, making the decision more likely to fall in their favor. 

In a way, you reading a text like this is beneficial to you. A text that tells you that long term decisions are good for you, makes you more likely to engage in those long term decisions. In a way it almost becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Especially if you start forming a conscious intention around the information just ingested. In a way a conscious intention (maybe you could call it "willpower" or "motivation")  is a pre-strengthening of parts of the circuitry in your brain fighting with each other. If you can get the right circuits to pre-strengthen, it makes it easier to decide well forever.

So in the end, making good decisions is about preparation. Since you don't really have a free will, the only thing you can do is to hope to be exposed to as much positive input as possible, that strengthens your neural networks responsible for solid, long term thinking choices, so that in the long term these circuits are winning the neural fight over your motor circuits more often. And then that is when you might have a good life. When you read more, learn more and become a better version of yourself. Where you reflect and meditate and do great work, because you have the brain to support those good choices...

## Is that all though?

There are a few more questions that I think are not properly understood within this model of the brain and decision making. First - when we decide on something meta, so decide about what decisions to make in the future, like you maybe just did... what has happened? When you form an intention to decide more in this or that way in the future... what has happened? And where did that "initial" thought come from? Can we trace it back to some childhood memory of your parents giving you attention when making good choices and that's why you crave more of it? And if so, isn't reading this or anything else automatic then, since you were bound to do something like it anyways, because of things outside of your control?  

And second - when you do something that has not been done before, something creative, that you could have not seen anywhere else before, what did you do? What was that choice that you made and where did it really come from? How can semi-random connections of semi-random brain cells lead to a creative insight? And what triggers the creative insight in the first place? Who did the deciding? And maybe more importantly - what does that say about the answer to the question of: Who are you? 

If I find any answers to these questions, that satisfy my curiosity and sound plausible and have solid explanatory power, I will probably write a post about them and link to it from here... 

But until then. Enjoy your life, use this text as a neural stimulus to make your intentions of making good decisions stronger and strengthen the neural networks that engage in the fight over what you do every day. So that they are more aligned with what you want to do long term, your goals and ambitions. Then rinse and repeat. 

Read more like this, learn, listen, understand and cultivate a character, that is more likely to do the right thing, no matter the circumstances, because the mental circuitry is so hardened in its tracks that even in face of strong stimuli to the opposite, it can make the "right" choice and not do the stupid monkey thing. I think that is the long term goal and journey of becoming a better version of oneself. A journey I am on and I hope so are you. Good luck on it.
