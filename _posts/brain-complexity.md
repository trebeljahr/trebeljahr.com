Decisions are the most important things in life, if you were to sum up your life in the most concise way possible it would be about the big decisions that you have made. And yet, there is a fundamental problem with decisions... you can't  make them.

The question of free will is a  old one, but it seems that what our brains do, is pre-determined by the environment. So what we experience as free will is an illusion that our brains create to help us get along. An illusion that motivates us to survive.

## What decisions  are.

However, reality looks very different. In reality a choice is nothing more than neural networks in our brain, chattering in their electronic signals. Trying to get control over the motor circuitry so that they can affect how the body moves. At each and every decision, this is what happens. Multiple networks of neurons fire and try to inhibit each other fighting for this control over the motor cortex. What we experience as a decision we have made is the result of that competition. The network that ended up winning over the others and now has control over the activity of the motor neurons.

That is when we move, when we act out our decision. Something funny happens at that moment as well, we start to think of the thing we are doing as if we have decided it "ourselves". Even though there was no "self" to be found anywhere within the competing neural networks. They are only neurons communicating with each other, trying to gain control of some other neurons nearby. So, if we think about that, how can it be that you, me, or anybody, can "learn" to make better decisions? And where even do those "better" decisions come from?

## Self-Reference.

I find questions like this very puzzling. They have this self-referential nature, which is the whole topic of Gödel, Escher, Bach (one of the greatest books of all time in my opinion, if you haven't you should  buy a copy and read it).

Anyways, self-Reference is what makes differential equations and recursive algorithms, behave in such unique and interesting ways. It can create vast, un-interpretable, un-predictable complexities, from very simple facts and equations. And our brain is full of these self-references. Awareness of your thoughts, which is neurons listening to the activity of other neurons. You get the point. There are circuits, controlling circuits, which control the original circuits and so on, in nested loops, down to the very bottom. All of which build up in a unique and highly complex pattern, a pattern that makes you you.

Outputs of those loops to the motor circuits is  what decisions are in the end. The consequence of those recursive processes, manifesting in the intricate patterns of movement and behavior. So... what is one doing when one learns to make better decisions?

I think it is the selective strengthening of only some of those recursive, competing circuits. This strengthening nudges the overall outcomes of the competition into a certain direction. That is what learning how to make better decisions is, selectively strengthening only those circuits, that lead to behavior that is better for you in the long-term. 

That is essentially what habits are in the end as well. A form of learning to make better decisions. Since we know that what fires together wires together, we can use that fact to strengthen the circuits responsible for that act only, and we are more likely to do it again in the future, especially if the immediate consequences of that act had a positive effect.

## Meta-Decisions.

Now comes the recursive, meta-decision part. In a way, when you read this text, neurons in your brain map the words into understanding and this text promises something that you want - namely the knowledge of how to make better decisions. Therefore the next time you have a difficult decision to make, your brain has changed a little bit, and the networks within it, that correspond to long-term interest are just a little bit stronger, making the decision more likely to fall in your favor.

In a way, you reading a text like this is beneficial to you. Something that tells you that long-term decisions are good for you, makes you more likely to engage in those long-term decisions. In a way it almost becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. 

Especially if you start forming a conscious intention around the information just ingested. In a way a conscious intention (maybe you could call it "willpower" or "motivation") is a pre-strengthening of circuitry in your brain. If you can get the right circuits to pre-strengthen, it makes it easier to decide well.

So in the end, making good decisions is about preparation. Since you don't  have a free will, the only thing you can do is to hope to be exposed to as much positive input to your brain as possible. Input that strengthens only your neural networks, which are responsible for solid, long-term thinking choices, so that in the long-term these circuits are winning the neural fight over your motor circuits more often. 

And then, that is when you might have a good life. The life where you read more, learn more and become a better version of yourself. Where you reflect and meditate and do great work, because you have the brain to support those good choices.

## Is that all though?

There are a few more questions that I think are not properly understood within this model of the brain. First - when we decide on something meta, like deciding about what decisions we want to make in the future... what has happened? When you form an intention to decide more in this or that way in the future... what has happened? And where did that "initial" thought come from? Can we trace it back to some childhood memory - of your parents giving you attention when making good choices and that's why you crave more of it? And if so, isn't reading this or anything else automatic then already, since you were bound to do something like it anyways, because of things outside of your control, because of your unchangeable past?

And second - when you do something that has not been done before, something creative, that you could have not seen anywhere else before, what did you do? How did you do it? What was that choice that you made and where did it  come from? How can semi-random connections of semi-random brain cells lead to a creative insight? And what triggers the creative insight in the first place? Who did the deciding? And maybe more importantly - what does that say about the answer to the question of: Who are you?

If I find any answers to these questions, that satisfy my curiosity, sound plausible and have solid explanatory power, I will write a post about them and link to it from here...

But until then. Enjoy your life, use this text as a neural stimulus to make your intentions of making good decisions stronger.  And strengthen the neural networks that engage in the fight, over what you do every day. So that they are more aligned with what you want to do long-term, your goals and ambitions. Then rinse and repeat. 

Read more like this, learn, listen, understand and cultivate a character, that is more likely to do the right thing, no matter the circumstances. Because the mental circuitry is so hardened in its tracks that even in face of strong stimuli to the opposite, it can make the "right" choice and not do the stupid monkey thingy. I think that is the long-term goal and journey of becoming a better version of yourself. A journey I am on and I hope that you are on it too. If you are, good luck on it.
