description: 'I want to spend some time over the next years following an idea I call "1-month projects". The idea is simple: spend one month at a time pursuing a single thing. Awesome projects that interest me and that I always wanted to do, but never gave myself the time to do. I want to take that time.'

<p>{description}</p>

During those 1-month projects, I work on something, pushing myself to my limit. Going as far as I can go, so that at the end of the month, I have built a nice and beautiful demo to showcase on the internet (or something in the real world). Along the way, I want to produce at least 1 artifact – a post documenting the things I have learned during the month.

## Why?

My main goal with all of this is to explore the wild space of possibilities that exist out there and live a life filled with "adventures" and learning. A life where I can follow my curiosity and maybe find something that I like so incredibly much, that I want to pursue it for a much much longer time (maybe even the rest of my life).

The idea that I am trying to fight with these 1-month projects, is that you can **only** do one thing if you want to "succeed in life". It somehow goes against my grain. And I don't want to accept it. There are too many aspects to life, too many things I love, that I don't want to chose only one of them. 

## Not another bucket list...

Something I realize is that the below is a bucket list of sorts. And I also know, that people usually never tick off things on their bucket list. 

My plan to protect myself from this is to put this bucket list out here on the internet, because having it publicly visible, acts as a very potent reminder to my monkey brain. It keeps me accountable. 

The second hack is that I share this with my friends. People like [Marc Nitzsche](https://www.marcnitzsche.de/) who can and will keep me directly accountable for not following through. I want to do these things. If I don't I would regret that. Life is precious and time is short. Try to keep that in mind.
