# Now

I am currently in Berlin, at home, working for [Ironhack](https://ironhack.com) as
a "part-time web development lead teacher". This means that I teach people how to program to earn a living.

It also means that I only work for 12 hours a week and have the rest of my time free for working on personal projects. 

When not working for Ironhack, I spend my time working on one of my [1-month projects](/1-month-projects). In a way, most of this blog is from one of those, as is the site over at [fractal.garden](https://fractal.garden). And there is more to come.

This month (October 2022) I am working on building an interactive deep dive article/demo showcasing different Collision Detection Algorithms.

I also try to read a lot and you can find what I have read, some of it with notes at the [/library](/library) of this site.

Besides this, I regularly have long, drawn-out discussions with friends, play a lot of beach volleyball and go to Hell Night, a parkour-focused strength/endurance training in Berlin, every week.
