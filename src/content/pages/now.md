# Now

I am currently in Berlin, at home, working at [Ironhack](https://ironhack.com) as
a part-time web development lead teacher, where I teach people how to program. 

This means I only work for 12 hours a week and have the rest of my time free for working on my own stuff. I read a lot and you can find the results within the 
[/booknotes of this site](/booknotes).

The plan for how I want to spend my time is an idea I call "1-month projects". 

## 1-Month Projects 

The idea is that I am making time to write about things that interest me and tickle my curiosity. Things that I want to do, but usually wouldn't take the time to do. Side Projects I want to do, just because I feel like it. 

During those 1-month projects, I will pick a topic and then detail the progress weekly so that at the end of every month, I have built a nice and beautiful demo to showcase here, on this site. Along with posts, documenting the process.

## Currently Working on: 

No. 2 - Deep Dive into Collision Detection

A list of other possible 1-month project ideas is below, as of now they are random in order and some of them are arguably a bit wild to do in a month, but anyways, the plan for the next year is to tick off 12 of them!
