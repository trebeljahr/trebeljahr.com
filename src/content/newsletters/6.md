## ✨ Quote ✨

> Worship the time you have. Spend time on being weird because that means you’re being yourself. Be kind to those who disagree with your weirdness.

## 🎙️ Podcast Notes 🎙️

Here's something I've been experimenting with: Listening to podcasts while taking notes. The edges are still a little rough, but you can check out the first few at [trebeljahr.com/podcastnotes](/podcastnotes).

## 🖇️ Links 🖇️

[**Everything might change forever this century (or we’ll go extinct)** by Rational Animations](https://youtu.be/3K25VPdbAjU). AI has the potential to change everything. The accelerating technological progress of today is distinctly different from technological progress in the past. The main takeaway for me is that technological progress is growing hyperbolically (even faster than exponential). If you like the style of animation and voice, you should also check out [the video on Grabby Aliens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3whaviTqqg).

[**Building A Virtual Machine inside ChatGPT** by Jonas Degrave](https://www.engraved.blog/building-a-virtual-machine-inside/). ChatGPT can generate a working terminal within itself, raising the question of how much of that terminal is faked text and how much of it is it genuinely encoded and run by the model... Is it a best guess at what a terminal would look like or is it *really* trying to emulate one? One thing this shows for sure: The possibilities of tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) are mindbending already. And those capabilities will only expand more in the near future. 

[**Neuralink Show and Tell** by Elon Musk and the Neuralink team](https://youtu.be/YreDYmXTYi4). TLDW: Neuralink will have trials in human patients within the next year. They are building the tools for rapidly scaling up production. They also focus on an integrated and tight feedback loop between engineering, design, and testing, while trying to make sure that their product is perfectly safe to use. This whole show made me thinking even more about the future. With brain machine interfaces and more advanced AI it's going to be wild. Matrix like technology will soon be reality. 

[**32 Powerful Ways To Stop Procrastinating** by Niklas Göke](https://nik.art/stop-procrastinating/). This post summarizes how to change your environment so that procrastination (or more generally bad habits) become harder, while good ones become effortless. It is very much inspired by the ideas from [Atomic Habits by James Clear](/booknotes/atomic-habits). The most important ideas for me: Anchor tasks, the 2-minute rule, a Tangent Bucket, and Decision Elimination.

[**A list of the best textbooks** by Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xg3hXCYQPJkwHyik2/the-best-textbooks-on-every-subject). Learning things is hard, but working through *good* textbooks makes it easier. But how do you find *good* textbooks? This is part of the answer. On a related note, there is also [this post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18104814) on HN, asking the same question. 

## 🌌 Midjourney 🌌

Midjourney now has a --v4 option.

Questions worth pondering about: How can I personally use AI tools like Midjourney and ChatGPT in the future? How are they going to impact the profession that I am currently working in?
