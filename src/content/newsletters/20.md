[**LLMs with chemistry tools** by Andres M. Bran et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05376.pdf). ChemCrow is an LLM that can do "autonomous task solving in chemistry". This means that the model can accurately describe the steps necessary in order to synthesize known as well as novel chemical compounds. Ask how to synthesize penicillin and it will happily answer. The model is built on an LLM that is consulting expert systems for the chemical details to prevent hallucinations. And the results are nuts. Especially from a safety point of view a lot of harm can be done with models like this. The authors recognized that and didn't release the full code for the model. But the rest, the part that is deemed safe, can be found on [Github](https://github.com/ur-whitelab/chemcrow-public/). 

[**An Erotic AI Chatbot** by JOI](https://joiaigirlfriend.com/). Yes. You can also use LLTMs for stuff like *that*... JOI is a telegram bot/"AI girlfriend" that sends erotic voice messages and even generated imagery. The thought of people actually falling in love with systems like this is creepy, especially when paired with the thought of not having enough credits to pay for the service anymore, or the company offering the service going bankrupt or changing the algorithm. The world we are moving towards is looking increasingly like an insane techno dystopia. Especially once technology like this is combined with widespread VR glasses, humanoid robots, or even brain-machine interfaces. We truly live at the beginning of a weird sci-fi movie.

[**AI powered Applications Builder** by TheForgeAI](https://theforgeai.com/). Build all sorts of crazy applications by connecting LLMs and other AI building blocks together to create incredible experiences all without any code but by dragging and connecting components together. They have a few examples of what is possible to build with the platform and a marketplace where people offer the stuff that they have built as well. To me, this shows the possibility of building crazy applications on the order of days in the future. Features once complex, needing entire development teams, will only need a little bit of drag and drop and AI magic to make a reality.

## 🌌 Midjourney 🌌


Midjourney got a BIG update as well: Version 5.2 dropped and it enables a new feature called "zooming out". Which allows cool stuff like this: 
![red haired girl](/assets/midjourney/red-haired-girl.webp)

This to me seems like magic. The consistency between the images is insane. It looks like a real person, put into different places. But how does it work?

The idea is to generate a base image like this: 
![high-quality closeup portrait of only the face of a beautiful woman](/assets/midjourney/high-quality-closeup-portrait-of-only-the-face-of-a-beautiful-woman.jpg)

Then zoom out with successive prompts adding more context like "in the Arctic", "in the desert", "on a street in New York" etc. so that Midjourney dreams up the base image with the surrounding context that you want. Would you have guessed that the wizard image at the beginning was generated this way? 

Anyways, with tech like this AI girlfriends will soon get their own online presence, starting to blur the line between what is real and what isn't even more...

You could even have an Instagram account for a person that doesn't exist, or create fake dating profiles. The possibility of deep-faking seemingly real personas to scam people just got a lot scarier as well. You can literally generate a person with a complete backstory, including images and profile data in a couple of hours... All of this means that we move towards a world where you can't really trust anything anymore unless it's GPG signed. 

Midjourney's zoom-out can also be used to generate nice pieces of art though. Here are some more examples:
