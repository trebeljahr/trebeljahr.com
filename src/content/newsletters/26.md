## ✨ Quote ✨

> You will live more curiously if you write. You will become a scientist, if not of the natural world than of whatever world you care about. More of that world will pop alive. You will see more when you look at it.

## 🖇️ Links 🖇️

[**ChatGPT can now see hear and speak** by Open AI](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-can-now-see-hear-and-speak). ChatGPT got ridiculously much better, kind of in what feels like overnight. It can now hear, see and speak. I.e. you can input images and voice prompts and ChatGPT will happily answer with a human like voice. This makes it even more accessible than before and the image mode especially is ridiculously good at analyzing and helping with tasks that ChatGPT previously couldn't handle because they required visual input. I am stoken and look forward to how this combines with the Dalle–3 access, once I have access to it.

[**Meta Connect**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dJu9VyIw64). I like watching keynotes like this one tremendously. It's reminding me of the fact that we are living in the future. Technological progress is accelerating every year and watching keynotes let's me viscerally *feel* that. Every year amazing, mindblowing stuff happens, and we get to know about it. And it doesn't matter to me whether it's from Meta, Google, Apple, OpenAI or Nvidia or somebody else entirely. It get's me excited. To me, the coolest announcement was that of good and [affordable AR glasses for as little as $299 USD](https://www.meta.com/smart-glasses/wayfarer-shiny-black-plano-g15-green/). This is ridiculous.

[**Array Labs 3D Mapping Earth from Space** by Not Boring](https://www.notboring.co/p/array-labs-3d-mapping-earth-from). In this piece Packy McCormick dives into the details of a company that has the bold plan to create a high resolution 3D map of the earth. The main takeaway is this: if they can pull it off, the company is going to be very very successful. However they need to solve extreme technical challanges. But they are building the teams and the technology to succeed. Having a 3D map of the Earth with 10cm per pixel resolution would enable *a lot* of cool stuff. Data provided by Array Labs could become a platform for people to build amazing stuff with. Think AR, self-driving cars... and military spy operations. 

[**Mark Zuckerberg Metaverse Interview** by Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYrJJNdrEg). WTF. 
Not only is this a good interview in true Lex Fridman style but truly a first of it's kind. The whole interview was conducted in the Metaverse with digital avatars that look and *feel* like humans. Even just watching the video is crazy, it's like watching Lex Fridman and Mark Zuckerberg having a real conversation. What would this sort of technology feel like if one actually was wearing proper VR/AR headsets? I think soon many of us will be able to find out.

[**The Chemical Code** by Enveda](https://www.enveda.com/posts/the-chemical-code-opportunity). We know a lot about the genetic code, but that doesn't mean we know how cells *really* work. Because to do that we would need to know about the chemistry that is going on *inside of cells*. Turns out we pretty much don't understand 99% of the chemistry that is happening right within us. And that is obviously bad. This piece dives into the ideas on how we can do better than this and how Enveda Biosciences is executing these ideas right now to create a new kind of drug discovery platform.
