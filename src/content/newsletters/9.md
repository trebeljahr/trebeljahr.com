## ✨ Quote ✨

> Look at the pattern this seashell makes. The dappled whorl, curving inward to infinity. That's the shape of the universe itself. There's a constant pressure, pushing toward pattern. A tendency in matter to evolve into ever more complex forms. It's a kind of pattern gravity, a holy greening power we call viriditas, and it is the driving force in the cosmos. Life, you see.

– Kim Stanley Robinson

[**Atoms are Local** by Century of Bio](https://centuryofbio.substack.com/p/atoms-are-local). Biotech is a fascinating discipline right now, and a lot of things are happening that many people are unaware of. Especially complementing biotechnology with AI in the right ways can lead to a future where "everything grows on trees". A future where anything we would like to have, can be created, and grown from organic materials within our own homes. This piece dives into how such a world might look like and how companies are striving towards this future *right now*.

[**Metagenomic Atlas** by Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/protein-folding-esmfold-metagenomics/). Even faster methods to solve the problem of protein structures are necessary, to understand *all* the proteins there are. Knowing the structure of a protein can help identify potential uses for it; therefore, the more proteins we know the shape of, the better. This paper developed a new method that can run protein shape predictions from DNA samples over an order of magnitude faster. The AI models they developed can go from a DNA sequence to the full protein shape in a matter of seconds which makes running them on whole databases of DNA samples possible.

[**Democratizing AI Interview, with Emad Mostaque** by Scale AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k124oUlY_6g). AI, right now, is in the hands of a handful few, big companies. The amount of data and computation necessary to build, train and maintain awesome models like ChatGPT, Dall-e, or AlphaZero are gargantuan and only a few big players in the field, like Microsoft, Google or Meta have the resources to do so. However, that's a very bad thing, considering the potential disruptions that breakthroughs in AI might have in the not-so-distant future. That's why Emad Mostaque founded Stability AI. To have a corporation that is designed so that its research results are publicly accessible and open source. So that everybody can help build this future and ensure it is beneficial to all. This interview dives into Emad's thinking behind this and what they are doing at Stability AI to make this vision come true.

[**Spinoza – A complete guide to life** by Then & Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leoBccWOZfo). I love this channel. Deep philosophical and political topics are dissected into beautiful documentary-length videos. Well researched and looking at things from different angles. This specific piece is about Spinoza, a philosopher that argued why we should learn more about the world. And why such a state of learning is the only ethical thing we can do in our lives. And how knowledge can lead to an overall happier life. Somehow Spinoza is a philosopher that I didn't know much about until now. But after watching this video I want to check out the original works, like "Ethics" as well.
