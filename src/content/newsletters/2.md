Welcome to the Awesomeness from the last 2 weeks, bundled together in a newsletter!

## ✨ Quote ✨

> We live in an era where nearly the entire sum of human knowledge is available at our fingertips, and yet people are blissfully unaware of the unique ideas and challenges that are pushing our understanding forward.

## 💻 Status Update 💻

The [fractal.garden](https://fractal.garden) is *done*. The month is over and the project is now successfully open source. If you know how to code and want to improve the project – check out [the Github](https://github.com/trebeljahr/fractal-garden) and the [issues page](https://github.com/trebeljahr/fractal-garden/issues). It's also part of the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)!

This month I am building Collision Detection Algorithm explanations.

And midjourney doesn't cease to amaze me.

I am compiling the most beautiful images I created with Midjourney as a separate page soon.

## 🖇️ Links 🖇️

[A digital garden/personal wiki – Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/). This is just *nuts*. This is like a [/needlestack](/needlestack) on steroids. It's so full with information and the amount of work that must have went into building this is insane. There is so much to learn and if you stop to write down all the things you tacitly know, the amount of stuff is staggering. Here somebody did this.

[Clippy – gwern.net](https://www.gwern.net/fiction/Clippy). A powerful story about an AI taking over the world. My hairs stood on end for the whole time while reading this.

[The Krebs Cycle – Nick Lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBiIDwBOqQA). A talk on the beauty and complexity of the Krebs Cycle. Nick Lane is a terrific author. All of his stuff is worth reading. I personally love [Oxygen](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Nick-Lane/dp/0198784937) and [The Vital Question](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Nick-Lane/dp/1781250375). The way Nick Lane distills crazy facts about biochemistry into memorable pictures is beyond beautiful. I vividly remember his description of how [ATP-Synthase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_synthase) is just a motor, driven by a proton gradient. A *motor*! Inside your cells! A motor, spinning really fast, slamming a piece of ADP and Phosphate into each other with a lot of speed, so that they combine into ATP, the stuff that powers *you*. Whenever you move, whenever you breathe, there is a gazillion of these little tiny things at work providing the energy. And Nick Lane tries to find out, *how* these molecules came to be the way they are. Fascinating stuff.

[How We Read Now – Charles Schifano](https://charlesschifano.substack.com/p/how-we-read-now). On the twisted nature of algorithms changing the way we consume information, and how most of the content we consume nowadays is a tailormade mirror of what we already know and are most likely to engage with.

[Stop and Reset the Loop – Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/odRdwD2GeCMfK7pXd/actually-practicing-rationality-and-the-5-second-level). Finally a piece of learning.
