## Quote 💬

> The history and the future of humanity can be seen as just the aggregate of all the individual life stories evolving through time.

## Status Update 💻
This month's [1-month project](/1-month-projects) is going well. I have been working a lot on collision-detection algorithms and interactive demos to explain how they work.

My midjourney subscription ran out, but here are some more pictures:

I simply love this tool and playing around with it, though I found out it's very bad at creating dinosaurs and dragons. 🥲 

## Song 🎶
Carolina in my Mind – Jacob Collier

The whole album is wonderful. But if I had to pick one song, that would be the one.

## Links 🖇️

[AlphaTensor – Deepmind](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/discovering-novel-algorithms-with-alphatensor). Basically AI is at the point where it can start to improve the algorithms it's based on (in this case matrix multiplications). Reading this paper feels scary because this is a gargantuan step towards recursive self-improvement and therefore the Singularity might be closer than we think.

[Better Thinking Tools – Adam Amran](https://untools.co/). A nice collection of thinking tools and mental models, very similar in spirit to Farnam Streets Mental models, but more concise and (unlike the FS books) entirely free!

[Screw motivation – Zbyhnev](https://www.wisdomination.com/screw-motivation-what-you-need-is-discipline/). On why motivation comes from discipline and not the other way around. And why habits are necessary for a productive life. I found it a bit hardcore, but it hit home nonetheless. 

[Useful Interweb – Johnny Webber](https://usefulinterweb.com/). This is like a giant needlestack assembled over a few years. A lot of the links are to books on Amazon.

[Consistency before Quality – Mike Crittenden](https://critter.blog/2021/01/18/consistency-beats-quality/). Found this blog and been browsing through some of his writing and liking it a lot so far.
