## ✨ Quote ✨

> I'm a person who's only satisfied if I feel I'm being productive. I like figuring things out. I like making things. And I want to do as much of that as I can.

– Stephen Wolfram - [(source)](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/)

[**GPT-4 Livestream** by OpenAI](https://m.youtube.com/live/outcGtbnMuQ?feature=share). The product demo livestream for the release of GPT-4. What it can do is absolutely insane, and I am extremely hyped to see what other things will come from people adopting it. Probably the coolest trend up to now is that of [HustleGPT](https://twitter.com/jacksonfall/status/1636107218859745286), where people let GPT-4 start small-scale businesses and then let it make all the decisions. Only following the instructions it provides, to see where it takes them in the real world. Even if it doesn't work now, what would happen in a society, where successful startups are founded by the ideas "dreamed" up by an LLM?

[**Personal Renewal** by John W. Gardner](https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches/personal-renewal-by-john-w-gardner). One of the best speeches ever given, full of wisdom. Every paragraph is quote-worthy. A little example: "Learn all your life. Learn from your failures. Learn from your successes, When you hit a spell of trouble, ask 'What is it trying to teach me?' The lessons aren't always happy ones, but they keep coming." The speech is about growing up, and how we should never stop doing it. It's about going through life filling it with meaning and purpose. It's beautiful. 

[**What We've Built Is a Computational Language** by Stephen Wolfram](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/). I knew of Wolfram Alpha but I didn't realize the extent of the project and what they were trying to do. Building a language unlike any other programming language out there. A language that can describe concepts in the real world and makes it easy to do computation on them. A revolution on equal footing with the invention of mathematical notation, if Stephen Wolfram is to be believed. A new way of building out thoughts and ideas. After reading this, I felt, damn, now I want to learn how to use it. And it turns out, for developers, it's completely free to use!

[**Life Hacks** by Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/lifehacks). A long list of awesome bite-sized snippets of wisdom and common as well as not-so-common sense. Two of my favorites: #134: "the richest people lose the most money, the most connected people get rejected the most, the most successful people fail the most" and #50: "we become the people whose opinion we care about".

## 🌌 Midjourney 🌌

Midjourney 5 came out as well, and oh my is it insane... The quality has just improved massively again, and things Midjourney used to struggle with – dragons, dinosaurs, and hands to name a few – now look ridiculously good. Distinguishing between an AI-generated image and a photograph of the real world is now pretty much impossible. And even crazier, upscaling these images is now instantaneous. It's a weird experience to interact with this "new" tool and I think I almost liked the older versions more because the images now feel *too* real. However, just appending words like "art", "stylized" or "oil painting" to the prompt fixes that and gives an infinite playground for turning ideas into beautiful visuals. Stock Photos are pretty much a thing of the past at this point.
