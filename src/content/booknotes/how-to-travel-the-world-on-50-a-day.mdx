## Summary: 

<p>{excerpt}</p>

If however, you have already acquired this mindset in some other way, by reading [Matt Kepnes' awesome blog for example](https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blog/) or by traveling yourself or maybe even by watching YouTube videos or whatever, you don't have to read this book. Most of the strategies in it, you will also get to know and pick up on the road yourself pretty quickly while out traveling. And quite a few things within it are very US-centric, especially the sections on travel hacking with US credit card rewards and similar things.

Overall it's a good book though. 

It's just that I read it at the wrong time. Reducing its value, for me, greatly. Like all books, the value they have for you depends greatly on when you read them.
