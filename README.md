# ricos.site - thoughts of a curious person

This is the repository from which the site at [ricos.site](ricos.site) is being built. 

It is built on Next.js, which generates static webpages from Markdown, which are then served via Vercel. This enables a blazing fast website, hosted completely for free. 

This is also the home of my blog which will cover a wide array of topics as broad as my curiosity, things like: personal development, nutrition, the workings of computers, brains, cells, economy, programming, music, traveling or photography.

I want to commit to writing for this blog, every day of the week, every week, publishing something whenever I feel it is ready. That is the whole goal of this exercise. 

This site should also serve as an artifact, that shows who I am and what I am doing. To showcase what I think and read. It should aggregate my learnigns and life lessons in a digestable form and help me organize my thoughts and serve as a reminder to myself. Of what I want to do and where I want to go. Furthermore it might one day be a valuable resource to other people besides myself. 

But that would be an added benefit not the main goal behind creating it.
